The UTSA Handbook is intended to be a living document filled with perspectives, opinions and information gathered from numerous students, old and young, incoming and graduated.

If you have something to add, please consider contributing! The process is easier than you think, and is an easy way to participate in open source and contribute to the UTSA CS community.
