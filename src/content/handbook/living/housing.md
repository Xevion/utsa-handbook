There are a lot of different options for housing around UTSA, and they all have their own style, price range, risk factor, and special benefits.
You should evaluate your own needs, preferences and abilities before making a decision.

For example:
- If you don't have a car, living near campus is a good idea.
- If you're looking to make friends and have constant social interaction, you may want to try the dorms.
- If you're looking for something cheap, you may want to move away from campus, find a sublease, or use the dorms in combination with financial assistance.
- If you want something with space, leasing a house or looking further from campus may be a good idea.
- If you want safety, you should know that on-campus housing has access to rapid response campus police (UTSA PD, not SAPD).
  - This may be accessible to nearby off-campus housing as well, but I'm not sure.

## On-Campus Housing

- Chaparral Village
- University Oaks
  - While technically on campus, it's not directly managed by UTSA and is also farther.
  - This technicality means that it has many of the same restrictions/benefits of on-campus housing.
  - No meal plan requirement.
- Alvarez Hall
- Chisholm Hall
- Guadalupe Hall
- Laurel Village
