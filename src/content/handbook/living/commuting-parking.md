- Campus Bus vs VIA
- Use parking lots and campus bus routes to your advantage
- Parking permits
- Hourly garages can be cheaper than a permit for some
- Parking tickets are expensive, but one warning per year
    - You can appeal them, but it's a hassle
    - Left unpaid, prevents you from graduating
- University Oaks close enough for biking
    - Phase 2/3 have bus stops nearby (straight to NPB)
