- [John Ortiz](#john-ortiz)

### John Ortiz

A passionate and high quality teacher who has a focus on **Assembly**, **Cryptography**, and **Operating Systems**.

- **High Difficulty**: While Ortiz is a great teacher, he is comprehensive and expects a lot from his students. You will learn a lot, but you will have to work for the grade.
- **No Attendance**: He does not take attendance, and he does not care if you show up to class or not. He also uploads all of his lectures to Canvas, so you can watch them at your own pace. That said, his lectures are very good and it is recommended to attend them.
