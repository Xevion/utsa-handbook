- Class projects are often highly regulated - they need to be easy to complete with clear guidelines
    - If you're an overachiever, it's rare that you'll be able to do something that's truly impressive
- If placed on resume, try to show that they're more than just class projects
    - e.g. "Started as a class project, but turned into a major project reaching 1000+ users"
- Special classes exist that allow for free form designed projects that are closely mentored and watched by professors
    - These are made in close cooperation with the professor
    - Need to be planned, approved and administered by the professor
