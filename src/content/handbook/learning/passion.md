- Finding your passion may take time
- Take your established interests and try to apply Computer Science
    - Video games? Try to make a mod, reverse engineer, or create your own
    - Photography? Build a portfolio, photo editing mechanism, photoshop extension, camera app
    - Music? Create a music player, music visualizer, or music creation software
- Don't be afraid to try new things
    - Everyone fails, it's part of the process
    - It's okay to not enjoy something at first, find it frustrating, or not understand it.
    - Even after years of experience, you may still find yourself struggling with something new
        - The only thing that really changes is your ability to cope with the struggle
        - Equate struggle with learning, improvement, and growth
        - Take breaks, talk about it, and ask for help
