When it comes to being hired, experience is often more valuable than expertise, as it's much easier to test and understand compared to genuine skill.

Many companies looking to hire do not have the resources to properly test your expertise, and even if they did - it's relatively easy to fake.
Experience, on the other hand, is much harder to fake; the assumption is that if you kept at something for several months/years, then you must have done something right or learned something.

Additionally, experience on the job is more valuable than education as it provides a more realistic view of what the job and environment will be like.
