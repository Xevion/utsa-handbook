- Internships
    - Usually used in combination with other methods
    - Low pay, mismatched work, or lackluster experience is not uncommon at first
    - Getting your foot in the door is very hard
- Volunteering, Clubs, Organizations
    - Unpaid, but the barrier to entry is very low
    - Easy way to get experience and build a network, acquire an edge on other interns resume-wise
- Contracting and Frelance
    - Difficult to break into, but can be very lucrative alternative for some
    - Requires a lot of self-discipline and self-promotion
- Research
    - Usually requires a good relationship with a professor
    - Can be very rewarding, but is often unpaid or low-paid
    - Stipend/grant-based funding (no negotiation)
    - Rigid requirements, but flexible and integrates with coursework
- Network
    - Whether through a friend, family, or acquaintance, a good network can get you a job
    - Not all companies are advertising positions, preferring to fill positions through word of mouth

These methods are ideal points to start from, but anything (i.e. fulltime work) is possible once experience is built.
